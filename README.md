### ©️2019 Run Buddy, Inc 

#### OSU Bootcamp
This website was used to teach Module 1 (HTML, CSS, and Git) and Module 2 (Advanced CSS). 
***Module 1 skills learned:***
* Interacted with the computer's file system by using the command line. This is a skill that developers use almost daily.
* Created an HTML document in VS Code.
* Applied meaning, context, and functionality to HTML elements by using HTML attributes.
* Interpreted a mock-up given to us by designers by dividing it into sections, or containers, so that we could create organized HTML content.
* Used Git to create a repository for the project and create reassuring save points throughout the build process.
* Used GitHub to create a remote location for the repository, and then published the project to GitHub Pages for others to see.
* Applied style and layout to HTML content by using CSS, learning about its syntax, rules, and quirks.
* Used the knowledge gained from building the Run Buddy landing page to create a Privacy Policy page.
***Module 2 skills learned:***
* Replaced the CSS floats with flexbox to create a more fluid layout.
* Applied media queries to accommodate multiple screen sizes and devices.
* Enhanced the visuals of the webpage with advanced CSS tricks such as pseudo-classes.
